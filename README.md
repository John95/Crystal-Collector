### How to use offline
To use this offline just run index.html through a browser by right clicking on the file and clicking 'Open with...' and selecting your browser of choice. 

## Continued Development
This program makes heavy use of jQuery and Bootstrap. To add to the story or develop new features for the game, start by going to game.js in the assets/javascript folder. That is where all the logic is currently. To add to the front end, modify index.html's Bootstrap styling, or edit style.css under the assets/css folder.

### Bootstrap
Bootstrap is the CSS Framework used to modify the style of this website. For more information on Bootstrap, visit [the docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/).
